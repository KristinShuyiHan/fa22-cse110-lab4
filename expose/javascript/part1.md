1. Line 9 will print the message "values added: 20"
2. Line 13 will print the message "final result: 20" to the console.
3. Line 9 will print the message "values added: 20"
4. Line 13 throws a ReferenceError with the message "result is not defined" because result is declared using  “let” inside the block of the if statement. Declaring a variable with the let keyword provides the variable with block scope, which means it only be accessed within the block it is defined in. Once the block exits the if block, the variable is no longer accessible. Thus, when the code tries to log the message "final result:" outside of the if block, which is not defined in that scope, a ReferenceError occurs.
5. The code will return an Type error because result was declared using const. Thus they are called “constants”. "constants" cannot be reassigned to a value. Trying to do so would cause an error. On line 7, the code attempts to reassign a new value to result by adding num1 and num2. Doing so will cause a TypeError.
6. Since line 7 violates the rules of declaring a constant variable, causing a Type Error, the code won't run to the console beyond the error message thrown on line 7.
